# StaticMeshRuntimeGeneration

This is a simple plugin for Unreal Engine that adds a new asset type that can capture the necessary information from a Static Mesh so a modified copy of it can be generated at runtime.

This can be useful for procedural games that generate static environments and don't want to use UProceduralMesh or other alternatives that have lower performance and more limitations than Static Meshes.

*Documentation will be fleshed out further
